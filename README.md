# Board-Detection
A game that allows you to control a board using a real one in front of your webcam

This game is divided in multiple part which allows to easily re-use them. 

The final version is separated in two versions :
* The "Game" one, which can be controled using the mouse and keyboard.
* The "TangibleGame" one, which can be controled using your webcam and a green board. By default, the tangible game is set to use a small movie to illustrate his purpose.
